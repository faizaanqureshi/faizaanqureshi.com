Grade 7 was a year of turmoil for me. I failed to meet my parents expectations and struggled in all subjects from Mathematics to Art. This wasn't the case of me being intellectually stunted or a lack of fundamental instruction but rather a lack of care for my educations and grades. I was hit with a reality check in that year when my application to my high school alma mater into the Pre-Advanced Placement program was rejected and put on a waitlist. I was left struggling to find my identity not only as a student but also as a person. It was clear that I would need to change my mindset and come into Grade 8 with newfound urgency.

## A Transformation

Grade 8 ended up being the best year of my academic career, and I was selected from my school to become the Student of Excellence from the Halton District School Board. I can tell some of my ex-teachers found this as a shock since it's not that common to hear a student going from average at best to topping the class over the course of one summer. While many may have thought I went to some tutoring classes or some other mentorship, the reality was that I was no different than I was the year before. I was the same student that Kumon said was 3 years behind my grade level in math, the same student who was kicked out repeatedly from class for poor behaviour. The only difference was that I actually gave a damn. I changed my perspective on not just school but learning in general. I fell in love with computers, mathematics, music, and many other fields. This accomplishment was my first small step in my journey for academic and intellectual success, one giant leap.

My parents and I were invited to an awards night in which highly esteemed students and their parents attended to celebrate their accomplishments. There were refreshments and speeches and a presentation of awards. At the end of the night, the head of the school board said something I will never forget.
