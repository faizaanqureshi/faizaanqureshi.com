This is by far the most inspirational quote I've read in my life. There is a deeper story to this quote and my fondness for it originates from a time about five years ago.

## The following is an excerpt from an article written by a local newspaper.

Faizaan Qureshi â€¢ P.L. Robertson Public School

Faizaan is an exemplary student, and an exceptional leader, both within and beyond the classroom. He demonstrates continued dedication to all aspects of school life, and has been a participant with various clubs and activities, including the senior basketball team, advanced band, student council, Me to We, PLR TV, musical cast member, and volunteering at school events, including our Fall Fair. He is a student who is determined to achieve his personal goals, both academic and extracurricular, and models positive learning for all of his peers. Faizaan is an innovative student, who continually thinks outside of the box on projects and presentations, and tries to push his own boundaries. He is inspirational to those around him, and a natural leader.
