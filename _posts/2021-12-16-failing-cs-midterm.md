LOL.

It was an ordinary November Friday, except that I had my second computer science midterm. I was taking CS135 at the University of Waterloo, a course I really enjoyed. It really taught me a lot about recursion and building programs and functions that depended/coexisted with each other. There were many topics such as mutual recursion, and mutual recursion that really helped me develop my understanding. While I didn't perform outstanding in my first midterm, I still passed above the average. Nothing could have prepared me for the shock I would recieve once grades were released a few days later...

## 17%!?!?

I definitely didn't get enough sleep on the day of the midterm. I wrote it at home since it was online and I stupidly decided to take it in the 8 AM slot since I had math classes in the afternoon. This proved to be a disastrous idea. I still don't know what I did that morning and how I was able to completely underperform in every sense of the word. When I first received my grade, I pretty much sent in a regrade request as soon as I saw it and a deep sense of dread and disbelief came over me.

## Great, now I have to actually try on the final ðŸ˜­

I had a pretty amazing assignment average until this point. Even after the midterm, I still achieved high 80s in most of my assignments. This lead me to be pretty relaxed throughout the whole semester since most of our grade was derived from these. Unfortunately, there was one caveat and nuance detail that would destroy me inside...

## To pass the course: Your weighted average of the midterms and final must be 50% or greater.

"Holy ****" is what I said to myself shortly after. Even this wasn't that big of an issue because after doing some calculations, it turns out that I only needed a 58% on the final. But the psychological blow and imposter syndrome that this midterm put on me left me incredibly nervous and as many would say, "down horrendous". I felt like I couldn't even tell my roommates how I did on the midterm (although eventually I just did and we had a good laugh about it). The instructors ended up giving me an extra 4% probably out of pity.

I did my final on the day I'm writing this at 12:30 pm. I'm definitely satisfied with my performance and I'm glad I was able to shake off the nerves early on.

## Moral of the Story/What I learned

Sleep is incredibly important. Also, never be too confident in your abilities, at any moment one small slip up can crush you to the bottom of the Earth. Be grateful for the situation you're in and if you're in a tough situation, relax and just keep on swimming.
