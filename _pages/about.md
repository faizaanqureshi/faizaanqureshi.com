Oh... Hello! You want to know more about me?! Odd. My name is Faizaan (as you've probably guessed by now) and I am currently a Computer Science and Business Administration student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier Univerisity. 

When I'm not struggling in my degree required math courses, I'm either playing basketball, driving around the Greater Toronto Area with my friends, or sleeping. I'm an avid Raptors and Kyle Lowry fan. I've even had the honour of holding the Larry O'B in person. I find comfort in food, large urban areas, quiet nights in the country, and just standing in front of a blackboard on campus swallowed up in my math problems or coding projects. I have experience in languages such as Java, Python, and Racket, and have gained enough intuition to be able to create this website ;) 

I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn, work, and meet new people. Have a question for me? Feel free to give me a ring at +1 647-447-4933 or shoot me an email at qfaizaan@gmail.com, I'd love to chat!
